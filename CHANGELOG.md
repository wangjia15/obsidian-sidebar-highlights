# Changelog

All notable changes to the Sidebar Highlights plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **AI assistance for highlights.** Off by default; no network call is made until it is switched on, a provider is configured, and the first send is confirmed. Nine builtin providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Moonshot, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio) plus any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, reachable from a highlight's context menu, its sparkles button, or the command palette.
- **Six builtin prompts** — summarize, explain, translate, key points, ask, diagram — each of which can be edited, disabled, or replaced. Editing a builtin stores only what you changed, so improvements to the shipped wording still reach you. Custom prompts can be written against `{{selection}}`, `{{note}}`, `{{comments}}`, `{{tags}}` and others, and exported or imported as JSON.
- **A result panel** that previews an answer before it touches the note: insert it as a comment, copy it, ask a follow-up, regenerate, or switch provider and compare.
- **Batch runs** over every highlight in a note, executed one at a time with a progress line, a stop button, and a summary of anything that failed.
- **Mermaid and rich rendering for comments.** A comment containing a fenced block, table, list or quote is now rendered with Obsidian's full markdown pipeline; mermaid blocks become diagrams, and clicking one opens it full screen with zoom and pan. Applies to every comment, not only AI-written ones, and can be switched off.
- **Streaming responses** on desktop, with automatic fallback to a normal request when a stream cannot be established.
- **Local usage totals** for the current month — call and token counts only, never prompts or answers.

### Changed
- **Multi-line footnote comments are now read in full.** A footnote definition's indented continuation lines belong to the comment, matching how Obsidian renders it. Previously only the first line was shown in the sidebar, so a comment holding a code block or diagram appeared truncated. Deleting such a comment now removes the whole definition rather than leaving its continuation lines behind as stray text.

### Fixed
- A footnote definition with nothing after the colon no longer adopts the following paragraph as its content.
## [1.41.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **You can now group highlights by heading.** Pick Heading from the group menu and each highlight files under the heading it sits beneath, much like Kindle groups your notes by chapter. The groups run in the same order as the note, so reading down the sidebar is reading down the page, and anything above the first heading collects in a "No section" group at the top. In the Folder and All notes tabs each group carries the note's name in front, so two notes with an "Introduction" heading don't end up muddled together.

## [1.40.3] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- **Only one Highlights panel received live updates.** When more than one Highlights view existed in a session, whether a second pane, a pop-out window, or a view another plugin hosts inside its own layout, only the most recently created one kept updating. Every other open panel rendered once and then sat frozen, and closing the newest one stopped updates everywhere until the plugin was reloaded. Changing a panel's view mode forced a redraw and made the missing highlights appear, which is what made this look intermittent rather than consistent. Every open panel now updates together, a closed panel stops being tracked, and a panel sitting on Tasks or Collections no longer holds back another panel that is showing highlights.
- **"Go to collection" could act on a panel you were not looking at.** With two panels open, the command revealed one panel and switched a different one to the collection. It now navigates the panel it just revealed.

## [1.40.2] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed
- **Phantom highlights from `==` inside inline code containing backtick runs.** The inline-code exclusion paired backticks one at a time, so a double-backtick span (the standard way to show code containing a backtick) or any stray backtick shifted every computed code range on the line — `==` markers inside code then escaped the exclusion and paired into phantom highlights spanning prose. Inline code is now matched the way Obsidian renders it: a run of N backticks closes at the next run of exactly N.
- **Escaped highlight delimiters are honored.** `\==not a highlight\==` now stays literal, matching Obsidian's rendering. Task text gets the same treatment, where an escaped `=` is also now displayed without its backslash, as Obsidian displays it.

## [1.40.1] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed
- **Literal `==` in notes was misread as highlights.** The detector accepted `== spaced ==` as a highlight, and even paired two stray `==` markers from different parts of a note into one highlight spanning everything between them — none of which Obsidian actually renders. Highlight delimiters now must touch the text on both sides, the same flanking rule Obsidian applies to `==`, so literal `==` stays literal. Real highlights are unaffected, including multi-paragraph highlights. `%%` comments are intentionally unchanged, since Obsidian renders `%% spaced %%` comments just fine. Note: anything the old rule wrongly detected disappears from the sidebar on the next scan, along with any comments or collection membership attached to it.

## [1.40.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed
- **Adding an inline comment to a highlight with a custom color failed** with "Could not insert inline footnote." Since 1.17.0 the footnote manager identified HTML highlights by whether the highlight carried a color, a rule from when only HTML highlights could. A standard highlight that had been given a custom color was therefore routed to the HTML tag parser and never matched. It now keys off the detected highlight type, so colored highlights accept inline comments like any other.

### Changed
- **Release assets are now cryptographically attested.** Starting with this release, GitHub build provenance attestations are published for main.js, manifest.json, and styles.css, so you can verify the files you install were built from this repository's source.
- Timers and DOM element creation now go through Obsidian's window-scoped helpers, improving correctness when the sidebar lives in a popout window.
- A large internal cleanup pass driven by the community plugin review: fire-and-forget saves and refreshes are explicitly marked, UI callbacks that do async work are typed as such, and the remaining loosely typed internals were given real types. No behavior changes are intended from this pass.

## [1.39.1] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- Removed a leftover empty style element the plugin injected into the document head at startup. Custom colors and typography are applied through CSS variables, so the element never carried any styles and nothing changes visually. Injecting style elements is disallowed by Obsidian's plugin guidelines and was the one error failing this plugin's automated community review.

### Changed
- The author link in the plugin manifest now points to GitHub instead of LinkedIn, whose bot blocking made the community directory's link checker report the URL as unreachable.

## [1.39.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Current folder tab**: A new tab listing highlights and comments from every note in the folder of the note you're viewing, so a project's annotations can be reviewed together without adding anything to each one. The folder is always taken from the active note, so the tab follows you as you move around the vault. "Include notes in subfolders" in the overflow menu widens it to the whole tree, and the tab's tooltip names the folder currently in view. The tab is hidden by default. Enable it in Settings → Views.
- **Filter by color**: A Colors category in the filter menu listing the colors actually present in the current tab, with multiple selectable at once. Colors are labelled with your own names from Settings where you've set them, and highlights carrying colors from HTML or Highlightr are included alongside the built-in palette.
- **Filter by type**: A Type category in the filter menu with three choices: highlights and comments, highlights only, or comments only. Comments-only was not previously expressible.

### Changed
- **The native comments toolbar button has been removed.** What it did now lives in the filter menu under Type, which also offers the comments-only view the button could not reach. Your current setting carries over: if you had native comments hidden, the filter starts on "Highlights only".
- The filter menu's Clear now also clears color filters and resets the type filter, and the filter button's active state reflects both, so neither can narrow the list without showing that something is filtered.
- The filter menu now always opens. It previously refused, reporting no filters found, in vaults with no tags or collections, which also hid the new Type and Colors categories.

### Fixed
- **Toggle highlight comments could not be switched off.** In vaults where no highlight had a comment attached, the button turned on and stayed on, writing that state back to settings on every click.
- **The filter button was disabled in the Tasks tab**, making the Status and Due date filters unreachable from the tab they belong to. A regression from 1.36.0, when moving Revert highlight colors into the overflow menu shifted the positions the toolbar used to identify its buttons.
- **New collection was unclickable in the Collections overview**, leaving the collections grid with no way to create a collection. The same 1.36.0 shift; the button being kept enabled there was identified by position, and the position had moved.
- Navigating to a collection from the command palette marked the wrong tab active when any tab was hidden.
- Hiding the tab you were currently viewing left the sidebar showing a hidden view with no tab selected.

## [1.38.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Collapsible groups**: Group headers now fold their contents, in both the highlight tabs and the Tasks tab, with a rotating chevron showing the state. The current note tasks section at the top of the Tasks tab collapses too. Collapsed groups are remembered across reloads. Task sections keep collapsing independently, so expanding a group restores its sections to whatever state they were in.
- **Sort by source note and creation date**: Six new sort options — source note title, note creation date and highlight creation date, each in both directions. Sorting on the note title rather than the file path makes a list drawn from several notes readable, since folder structure no longer drives the order. Source-note and note-date sorting are available in every tab. Items with no timestamp sort last rather than appearing as the oldest.
- **Remove comments with highlight**: New setting, off by default, so removing a highlight also removes its comments and any footnote definitions left orphaned. With it on, the menu entry renames itself to "Remove highlight and comments" so it never understates what it deletes.
- **Squircle task checkboxes**: Task checkboxes and the Tasks tab icon now use a squircle outline.

### Fixed
- **Clicking a task or highlight no longer opens a duplicate tab**: A note already open in a left or right sidebar is now reused and focused, rather than being opened again in the main area. This applies to task text, highlight text, comments, and the filename shown on each card. A modifier-click still opens a new tab.
- **Reading View is centred on the target**: Clicking a highlight, comment or task now centres it in Reading View, matching Editing View, instead of pinning it to the top of the viewport.

## [1.37.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Additional task checkbox states**: `- [/]` in progress, `- [-]` cancelled, and `- [?]` question now appear in the Tasks tab alongside `- [ ]`, `- [x]` and the priority markers, each with its own icon. Previously any unrecognised state failed detection and the task was dropped from the sidebar entirely. Clicking a checkbox still completes it in one click; the new states are set from the task menu. Cancelled tasks are treated as resolved and hidden along with completed ones.
- **Copy format options**: The copy action now offers three formats — with syntax, plain text, or as a list. Plain text and list drop the `==` wrappers, which are redundant once the surrounding document is gone. Native comment markers and `^[footnotes]` are kept in every format so annotations stay distinguishable.
- **Copy visible results in the Tasks tab**: The same copy action is now available for tasks, honouring every active filter.
- **Hide Tasks plugin metadata**: New setting, on by default, that hides scheduling metadata added by the Tasks plugin (due and scheduled dates, recurrence, priority) from task text in the sidebar. Both the Dataview style (`[scheduled:: 2026-08-20]`) and the emoji style are recognised. Your notes are never modified, and custom inline fields are left alone.
- **Configurable backup retention**: The number of automatic backups to keep is now a setting rather than fixed at 20. Manual backups are still never deleted.

### Fixed
- **Highlights containing inline code**: `==text `code` text==` and custom patterns containing backticks or fenced code blocks are now detected. Exclusion previously discarded any highlight that overlapped a code range, which meant a highlight containing an inline code span disappeared from the sidebar entirely.
- **Highlight colors from Highlightr**: `<mark>` highlights now show their real colour instead of always rendering yellow, for both Highlightr's inline-style and CSS-class modes. Also fixes 8-digit hex colours (`#RRGGBBAA`), which were previously dropped from the sidebar altogether.
- **Reading View navigation**: Clicking a highlight, comment or task in the sidebar now scrolls Reading View to it, centred, matching the behaviour in Editing View. Previously it opened the file but never scrolled.
- **Task nesting when completed tasks are hidden**: A sub-task whose parent is hidden by the completed-task filter no longer appears nested under an unrelated task earlier in the file.
- **Backup location with a custom config folder**: Vaults that override the config folder (Settings → About → Override config folder) had backups written to a hardcoded `.obsidian` path instead of the folder in use. Backups left in the old location are recovered automatically on load.
- **Duplicate backups**: Identical backups are no longer written repeatedly. External sync could fire several times in a row and each firing wrote another copy of unchanged data.

### Changed
- The current note tasks section now uses the same heading style as the other group headings, without the surrounding card.
- The release workflow now runs on current action versions and Node 22.

## [1.36.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Follow editor scroll**: New toggle in the toolbar overflow menu — when enabled, the sidebar automatically centers and selects the highlight closest to your editor's visible area as you scroll. Smooth scrolling, doesn't fight you when you scroll the sidebar manually, and works even when the editor doesn't have focus.
- **Toolbar overflow menu**: Secondary actions (Follow editor scroll, Copy visible highlights, Revert highlight colors) are now grouped under a single vertical-ellipsis menu at the far right of the toolbar to reduce clutter.
- **Copy visible highlights**: New menu item that copies all currently-visible highlights to the clipboard in markdown format. Respects every active filter — search, tags, collections, native-comments toggle, minimum character count — so you get exactly what you see in the sidebar. Each highlight is formatted with its `==text==` or `%%comment%%` wrapper plus any attached `^[footnotes]`, separated by paragraph breaks.
- **Right-click context menu on highlights**: Right-click any highlight in the sidebar for three new actions:
  - **Remove highlight**: Strips the `==`/`%%`/HTML wrapper, keeps the inner text and any attached comments.
  - **Remove comments**: Keeps the highlight wrapper, strips trailing inline footnotes, standard footnote references, and any orphaned `[^N]:` definitions.
  - **Remove highlight and comments**: Strips both.

### Fixed
- **Code blocks inside callouts and blockquotes**: Fenced code blocks prefixed with `> ` (callouts, blockquotes) or leading whitespace (indented list items) are now correctly excluded from highlight detection. Previously, `==` operators inside DataviewJS or other code blocks nested in callouts would produce phantom highlights in the sidebar.
- **Nested image-in-link URLs**: `[![alt](image-url)](destination-url)` syntax is now matched as a single link range. Previously the regex only captured the inner image link, leaving destination URLs exposed — which caused phantom highlights when destination URLs contained `==` (e.g. base64-encoded WeChat-style query parameters).

## [1.35.2] - 2025-11-08
